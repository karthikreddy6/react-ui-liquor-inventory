API notes for React (seller update)

Base URL
- http://127.0.0.1:5000

1) Read current stock (seller uses this to see present stock)
- GET /stock
- Response: JSON list of stock items with fields like id, brand_name, pack_size_case, pack_size_quantity_ml, total_cases, total_bottles

2) Update stock after today's sales
- POST /seller/stock-update
- Content-Type: application/json
- Body (by id):
  {
    "stock_id": 12,
    "available_cases": 50
  }
- Body (by composite keys):
  {
    "brand_number": "1024",
    "pack_size_case": 12,
    "pack_size_quantity_ml": 750,
    "available_cases": 50
  }

Rules
- Seller enters available cases after today's sale.
- Bottles are computed by server using pack_size_case.
  Example: if pack_size_case = 12 and available_cases = 50, then total_bottles = 600.
  If pack_size_case = 24, then total_bottles = 1200.
- total_amount is recalculated from unit_rate_per_bottle (if present) or rate_per_case.

Response (success)
- { status, stock_id, brand_number, brand_name, pack_size_case, pack_size_quantity_ml, total_cases, total_bottles, total_amount }

Errors
- 400 if available_cases is missing or invalid
- 400 if stock lookup keys are incomplete
- 404 if stock item not found
